Welcome to Social Spreadsheet. Social Spreadsheet allows editing of a spreadsheet by multiple users over a network. Here I will provide a few short notes on how it may be used.
</p>
<p>
  <h4>To Begin</h4>
</p>
<p>
  The <b>File</b> menu contains four options, <b>Create(New)</b>, <b>Join(Open)</b>, <b>Save(Save)</b>, and <b>Leave(Close)</b>. Select <b>Create</b> or <b>Join</b> to begin working on a spreadsheet. <b>Create</b> is to create a new spreadsheet to work on. <b>Join</b> is to begin working on an existing spreadsheet. For either selection a window will show asking for a server, port, filename, or password. If you have selected <b>Create</b> the filename and password are chosen by you.
</p>
<p>
  <h4>To Edit A Cell</h4>
</p>
<p>
Select a cell by clicking on it. The cell's name will appear in the box labeled <b>Cell</b>, its value will appear in the box labeled <b>Value</b>, and its content will appear in the box labeled <b>Content</b>.
</p>
<p>
Edit a cell by typing in the <b>Content</b> box and pressing the enter or return key to finalize a change. Start your entry with the = character to enter a formula.
</p>
<p>
Select <b>Save</b> to save a file in its current location and  under its current name. Select <b>Leave</b> to close your current window.
</p>
<h4>Formulas</h4>
<p>
In addition to numbers and strings, you may enter formulas that will calculate a value based on the values of other cells. Begin a formula by typing = in the content box. Allowable symbols in formulas are numbers, *, /, +, -, (, ), and variables. Variables are references to other cells. Allowable variables run from A1 to Z99.
